# STEPS:

1. make copy of .env.sample file as .env

2. update the following in .env file:

   - DB_HOST: hostname or the name of container if running via docker (typically db)
   - DB_DATABASE=name of database
   - DB_USERNAME=database user name
   - DB_PASSWORD=database password (this will also be root password)

> **to change default port numbers (80 for nginx & 3306 for mysql), open docker-composer.yml file and change ports for db and nginx**

3. Bring up the docker via following command:

   `docker-compose up -d --build`

   > Take note of container names that comes as "Starting <CONTAINER_NAME> ... done"

4. Make sure all docker images show status as 'UP' via 'docker ps' command

   > If any error related to port number is shown, then make sure no other process is using the port numbers defined in docker-compose.yml file

5. Login to mysql container:

   `docker exec -it <DB_CONTAINER_NAME> /bin/bash`

6. Once in bash, login to mysql using:

   `mysql -uroot -p`

   > Use the password you defined as DB_PASSWOED in .env file

7. Once logged in,run following 2 commands, change <DB_USERNAME> & <DB_PASSWORD> as defined in .env file:

   - `CREATE DATABASE <DB_DATABASE>`
   - `CREATE USER '<DB_USERNAME>'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<DB_PASSWORD>';`
   - `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE, DELETE, RELOAD, SHUTDOWN, FILE, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON *.* TO '<DB_USERNAME>'@'%' ;`

8. Once above are done, you can login to mysql using above user and password to confirm it's creation.

9. Next step is to import dashboard database:

   `docker exec -i <DB_CONTAINER_NAME> mysql -u<DB_USERNAME> -p<DB_PASSWORD> <DB_DATABASE> < db_import_file.sql`

10. Last step is to login to app docker and run composer install:

    `docker exec -it <APP_CONTAINER_NAME> /bin/bash`

    `composer install`

## TROUBLESHOOT:

```
